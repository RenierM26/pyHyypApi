# pyadtsecurehome
API for ADT Secure Home and IDS Hyyp. There could be more variants but it's easy to add package names to the constants.py file.

TO Do:

- Main module for CLI usage.
- Refine function output. It's all json at the moment.
- Refine failed messages. Catching broad excepts.
- Capture panic api...for obvious reasons.
- What zone caused arm/arm stay not to work. Should be in the arm response but can't seem to find it. (The app reports this)
