# pyadtsecurehome
API for ADT Secure Home. (Basically a skinned version of IDS Hyyp)

Still a work in progress and i need to figure out what the following is:


GCM_ID ?
IMEI ? This might be a constant between security companies or some or other unique id on the unit. It's defenitly not a imei id as we know it...too long.
